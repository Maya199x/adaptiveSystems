# Adaptive Systems

Project Description is available at [my university page](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~shaktik/) under Proactive Troubleshooting [Aug2018-Present].

I am updating this readme as we make progress, the individual files however have an extensive documentation. 

```experiment_sin_stability.py```
 
 This file discusses an implementation of stabilizing a noisy sin function. The noise here is modelled as a gaussian with a choice of mean and variance.
A reward structure promoting the stability is defined. The Utility values are learnt using Generalized Policy Iteration method.

If you would like to know more about this research feel free to drop me an email.
